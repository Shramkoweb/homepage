# Hi! It's my old site, [link to new website](https://shramko.dev/). 
My name is Serhii and this is my website.

I've hosted it in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), because it's so much easier, free, and saves my time.

Other than that it's just good old plain HTML and CSS. `<head>` is built using excellent [HEAD](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD) for reference. `<body>` uses some styles from the great [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI) framework.
Website tested with [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) automated tool and have good Metrics 100% ðŸ˜‡.
